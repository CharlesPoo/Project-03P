        <p class="award1"> <strong> The Winner Is.....Kim Kardashian West! </strong> Taking the world by storm with her horrendous crying, along with being the laughing stock of her family, according to Kourtney Kardishian, this ugly crier has won the first award! Come on up Kim! </p>
        <h3 class="award2"> Category 2: Best Strangest Music Video </h3>

        <p class="award2"> <strong> The Winner Is...."God is a woman" by Ariana Grande! </strong> Seriously sis, what is up with your music video? I get that you wanted a very elegant video, but it does not fit in with the vibe of the song.</p>
        <h4 class="award3"> Category 3: Best Movie </h4>
        <img src="http://smithsonianapa.org/bookdragon/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2014/04/If-I-Stay-and-Where-She-Went.jpg">
        <p> This is easily a very well directed movie, with moving imagery and soundtracks. The book, however, is not as good as the movie, which is odd. Step your game up, If I Stay novelized-version. </p>
